# Querylingo

Querylingo is a working in process LLM to parse Natural Language Queries to SQL and the other way around. This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis at the University.

## Main Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can parse natural language queries to SQL and the other way around. This tool should be able to understand the user's query and translate it to a SQL query that can be executed in a database. The tool should also be able to translate a SQL query to a natural language query that can be understood by the user.
